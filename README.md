This project was made just to learn more about game hacking and drawing on screen.

Drawing on sceen using GDI+ C++ (gdiplus.lib).

Advantages:
  - flicker free experience (if drawing a lot on screen it will flicker a bit).  
  - easier to use for starters than regular GDI.  
  - gamecapture proof

Disadvantages:
  - game has to run in windowed mode or BORDERLESS!


Includes:
  - basic aimbot (prefers closest to crosshair)  
  - noclip (G - toggle)  
  - ESP (box, health, direction lines)  
  - infinite ammo  -godmode
